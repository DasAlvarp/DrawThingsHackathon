Pixlatr
===================

Really rushed hackathon project which lets you draw things.

*TODO:*
* Insert hex values that actually do things.
* Pretty up the app
* pixelate the screen
* win
* not lose

HOW TO USE!
==================
* make your own crappy pixel art
* random noise is not optional-and you WILL love it!
